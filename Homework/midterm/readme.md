About:

"Our Little Home" is a pixel art inspired, interactive story made with p5js and Photoshop CC. To start the story, press 'Spring' and go through each different season to see the changes in pixel art along with various animations in p5js.

Instructions:

In Spring, petals rain down and pressing down on the mouse allows a different frame to appear, mimicking movement from the pixels.

In Summer, the moon rises and the cursor becomes a little firefly in the evening and pressing down on the mouse allows a different frame to appear, mimicking movement from the pixels.

In Fall, pressing down on certain keys makes the trees change colors and pressing down on the mouse allows a different frame to appear, mimicking movement from the pixels.

In Winter, snowflakes rain down from above and pressing down on the mouse allows a different frame to appear, mimicking movement from the pixels.

The End, features petals falling again and the ending title screen overlays over the background image.
