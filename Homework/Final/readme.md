About:

"Ramen Rush" is a 2D game intended for younger audiences where the user takes the role of Suzy, a waitress working at a noodle shop. Suzy accidentally trips while delivering delicious ramen to a customer and now must catch all of the ingredients as they fall from the air to save the precious noodles!

Instructions:

Move the mouse left and right on time to catch the good ingredients listed in the bar above the restaurant while avoiding the bad ones that don't belong in a noodle dish.

Libraries used: p5 Play and p5 Sound for the audio.

Explanation:

-Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?

The concept of the idea was born during our last class's "Workshop Ideation" session as a motivation to combine what I've learned in both of my classes this semester, which are 2D Character Design and CIM640.

-Who is the target audience for your project?

The intended audience for this project is for Children, of both genders; the game is intended to be simple enough for younger audiences, but with an aesthetic to draw in audiences older than 8+

-Where will your project be displayed?

Besides being a game, 'Ramen Rush' is intended to serve as marketing material for potentially new noodle restaurants that want to target kids and families and can be played on a restaurant's website or on the physical self-check out machines at the shop, etc.

-What are your inputs/outputs?

The user can click on the mouse to navigate the button interface and start screen to the instruction page and then with their mouse to take control of the character's X & Y position to catch good items and avoid the bad ones.

Good Items: Eggs, Veggies, Noodles, Shrimp, Meat
Bad Items: Egg Shell, Rotten Fish, Bugs, Soda Can

When a bad item is caught the game over screen appears with a sound effect and prompts the user to press on the try again text to re-start the game. When all good items are caught, the user is rewarded with a you win screen and a sound effect that let's them know they saved the ramen!
